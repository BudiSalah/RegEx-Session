# Quantifires

## `?` 0 or 1

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /cou?lor/g
); // [color, coulor]
```

> If used immediately after any of the quantifiers \*, +, ?, or {}, makes the quantifier non-greedy (matching the minimum number of times), as opposed to the default, which is greedy (matching the maximum number of times). see `.*?` for example.

## `*` 0 or more

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /\w*/
); // hello

// if the string start with 0 `\w` character then it will fulfilled the regex and return nothing
"#### hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /\w*/
); //
```

## `+` 1 or more

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /\d+/
); // 30
```

## `{length}` specific length

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /\w{2}/
); // he

// or
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. my phone number is 555-123-456".match(
  /\d{3}/
); // 555
```

## `{min,max}` range of length

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /\w{2,4}/
); // hell
```

## `.*` greedy

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /hello.*\./
); // hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(.
```

## `.*?` not greedy

```js
"hello world, my name is budi salah badawy. I'm 30 years old :(. my favorite color is red but this coulor is very strong so I don't wear it!".match(
  /hello.*?\./
); // hello world, my name is budi salah badawy.
